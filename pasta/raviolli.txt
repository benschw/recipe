Filling:

Pseudo-Vegan Béchamel

- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 240 ml (1 cup) plain oat milk, or other non-dairy milk, cold or at room temperature
- salt, pepper, nutmeg

- 4 cups grated (Beaufort, Comté, and Fontina)

- Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
- Add the flour, stir it in quickly with a wooden spoon, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously, without coloring (that's a roux blanc).
- Remove from the heat, add a little of the milk, whisk it in to form a smooth mixture.
- Return to medium heat, then add the rest of the milk over medium heat, a little at a time, whisking well between each addition. 
- Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring continuously, until thickened to a velvety consistency. 
- Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
- Stir in cheese, 1 cup at a time.
