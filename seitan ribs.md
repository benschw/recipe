## Ingredients
- 1 cup vital wheat gluten
	- (can replace 1/4c with chickpea flour)
- Dry Seasoning
	- 2 teaspoons smoked Spanish paprika
	- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
	- 2 teaspoons onion powder
	- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
	- Herbs (thyme, rosemary, sage)
- 3/4 cup water
- 1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- (optional: 2 tablespoons tahini or other nut butter)
- about 1 cup barbecue sauce

## Instructions

- Prepare
	- Preheat the oven to 350 and lightly spray an 8×8 baking dish with canola oil.
	- Mix the first 5 ingredients together in a large bowl.
	- Mix the water with the nut butter, Liquid Smoke, and soy sauce and add it to the dry ingredients.
	- Stir to mix well and then knead lightly in the bowl for a couple of minutes.
	- Put the dough into the baking dish and flatten it so that it evenly fills the pan.
	- Take a sharp knife and cut it into 8 strips; then turn the pan and cut those strips in half to form 16 pieces:
- Put it in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. While it’s cooking prepare your grill.
- Grill Prep
	- Remove it from the oven and carefully re-cut each strip, going over each cut to make sure that the ribz will pull apart easily later.
	- Generously brush the top with barbecue sauce.
	- Take it to the grill and invert the whole baking dish onto the grill (or use a large spatula to lift the seitan out, placing it sauce-side down on the grill).
	- Brush the top of the seitan with more sauce:
- Grill
	- Watch it closely to make sure that it doesn’t burn.
	- When it’s sufficiently brown on one side, turn over and cook the other side, adding more sauce, if necessary.
	- When done, remove to a platter and cut or pull apart the individual ribs to serve.


### No Grill
To make this without a grill, bake it for 25 minutes without barbecue sauce. Then brush the top with a generous coating of sauce, turn the whole thing over carefully in the pan, and brush the other side with sauce. Bake for another 10-20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened and caramelized slightly but not burned. Remove from oven, cut apart, and serve.
