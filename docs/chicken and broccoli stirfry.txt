## Chicken and Broccoli Stirfry
Makes 4 servings, with rice

Time: 20 to 30 minutes

Here is a model recipe for making stir-fry with "hard" vegetables, those that must be parboiled before stir-frying. The extra step actually saves time-it's much faster to soften broccoli and similar vegetables with a quick poaching than by stir-frying.

### Ingredients

- 1 recipe Seitan, cut into 1/4" slices
- 2 cups broccoli florets and stems, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tbsp peanut or other oil
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp peeled and grated fresh ginger
- 1 c sliced onion
- 1/2 c trimmed and chopped scallions, plus minced scallion greens for garnish
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/4 c vegetable stock
- 1 tbsp cornstarch (optional)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Instructions

- Broccoli Prep
	- Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.
	- Add the broccoli and cook just long enough to remove the hardest crunch. (about 2 minutes)
	- Drain and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking; drain again.
- Cook Vegetables
	- Place a wok or large, deep skillet over high heat. 
	- Add half the oil (1 tbsp), swirl it around, and immediately add half the garlic and ginger. Cook for 15 seconds, stirring. 
	- Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. 
	- Add the broccoli and 1/2 cup chopped scallions and cook over high heat until the broccoli browns and becomes tender. (about 5 minutes)
	- Turn the heat to medium and remove the vegetables. 
- Cook Seitan
	- Add the remaining (1 tbsp) oil to the pan, then stir in the remaining garlic and ginger.
	- Add the seitan. Raise the heat to high and stir the seitan every minute or two until browned. (about 10 minutes)
- Assemble Stir-Fry
	- Return the vegetables to the pan and toss once or twice. 
	- Add the soy sauce, and toss again. 
	- Season with salt and pepper. 
	- Add the Stock. If using cornstarch, combine the with the stock before adding.
	- Raise the heat to high and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the liquid is reduced slightly and the pan is de-glazed. If you've used cornstarch, the sauce will have thickened.
- Garnish and serve immediately, scooping out some of the sauce with each portion.

## Variations
### Stir-Fried Chicken with Kale or Collards
In place of the broccoli, simmer 2 cups washed and trimmed kale or collard leaves and stems for about 2 minutes. Rinse under cold water, squeeze dry, and chop. Proceed as above.

### Quick Additions
Add alone or in combination

- Add 1 teaspoon dark sesame oil with the soy sauce.
- Toss in 1/2 to 1 cup raw or roasted cashews or peanuts when you return the vegetable to the pan.
- Add 1/2 cup chopped shallots with the seitan.
- Use snow peas, mushrooms, or other quick-cooking vegetables, alone or in combination, in addition to or in place of the broccoli.
