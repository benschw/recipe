- salt and pepper
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

### Prepare soup
- Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the leeks and shallots and cook,
  stirring often, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
- Stir in the vegetable broth, then add the roasted beets and bay leaf.
  Bring to a boil and cook until the beets are heated through.

- Transfer the soup to a blender (in batches) and puree.
- Return the soup to the pot and stir in the salt, pepper. Cook mostly covered over medium heat until hot.

- Remove 1/2 cup of the soup and transfer this into a small bowl. Combine it with
  the sour cream, stirring with a whisk. Ladle the soup into individual bowls and
  top each serving with one tablespoon of the sour cream mixture. Using the tip
  of a knife, swirl the sour cream, making a pretty design.
