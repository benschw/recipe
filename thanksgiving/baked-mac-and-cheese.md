# Baked Mac & Cheese


## Ingredients

- Salt
- 2 1/2 cups milk (low-fat is fine)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 pound elbow, shell, ziti or other cut pasta
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 cups grated cheese, like sharp cheddar or Emmental
- 1/2 cups grated cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup or more bread crumbs, preferably fresh



## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it.
- Cook the milk with the bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.
  When small bubbles appear along the sides, about 5 minutes later, turn off the heat and let it stand.
- Cook the pasta
	- to the point where it is almost done but you would still think
	  it needed another minute or two to become tender.
	- Drain it, rinse it quickly to stop the cooking, and put it in a large bowl.
- Make the sauce:
	- Make a roux: 3 tbsp oil, 3 tbsp flour over medium-low heat until mixture browns, about 5 minutes.
	- Remove the bay leaves from the milk and slowly stir in until thick and smooth.
	- Stir in 2 1/2c cheese
		when it is foamy, add the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture browns, about 5 minutes.
- Pour the sauce over the noodles and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  Use the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to grease a 9-by-13-inch or similar-size baking pan and turn the pasta mixture into it.
  Top liberally with breadcrumbs and remaining cheese, and bake until bubbling and the crumbs turn brown, about 15 minutes. Serve piping hot.
