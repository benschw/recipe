### Ingredients

- 1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter (9 tbsp olive oil)
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup pine nuts or chopped walnuts
- 6 to 8 cups fresh bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon or sage leaves or 1 teaspoon dried crumbled tarragon or sage
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped scallion
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

### Instructions

- Put the butter in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. When melted, add the onion and cook, stirring, until it softens, about 5 minutes. Add the nuts and cook, stirring almost constantly, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.
- Add the breadcrumbs and the herb and toss to mix. Turn the heat down to low. Add the salt, pepper, and scallion. Toss again; taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the parsley and stir. Turn off the heat. (At this point, you may refrigerate the stuffing, well wrapped or in a covered container, for up to a day before proceeding.)
- bake in an ovenproof glass or enameled baking dish for about 45 minutes at 350-400Â°F. (Or you can cook it up to 3 days in advance and just warm it up right before dinner.)
