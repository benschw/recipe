## Ingredients

- 9 tbsp olive oil
- 1 c chopped onion
- 1/2 c pine nuts or chopped walnuts
- 6 to 8 c fresh bread crumbs
- 1 tbsp fresh herbs (tarragon or sage)
- 1/2 c chopped green onion
- 1/2 c chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Directions

- Prep the mixture
	- Put the oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. 
	- Add the onion and cook, stirring, until it softens (~5 min)
	- Add the nuts and cook, stirring almost constantly, until they begin to brown (~3 min)
	- Add the breadcrumbs and the herb and toss to mix
	- Turn the heat down to low. Add the salt, pepper, and scallion.
	- Toss again; taste and adjust the seasoning.
	- Add the parsley and stir.
	- Turn off the heat.

At this point, you may refrigerate the stuffing, well wrapped or in a covered
container, for up to a day before proceeding.

- Bake bake at 350-400 in an ovenproof glass or enameled baking dish for about 45 minutes.
  (Or you can cook it up to 3 days in advance and just warm it up right before dinner.)
