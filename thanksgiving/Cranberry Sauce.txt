## Cranberry Sauce

If cranberry sauce generally tastes too sweet to you, know that the sugar is what helps it gel. So go ahead and use less sugar if you want, but expect the sauce to be runnier. (A better solution for you might be to make Cranberry Relish with Orange and Ginger). If you want a very firm sauce, make the variation.
