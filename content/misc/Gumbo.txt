### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound spicy smoked sausage or kielbasa
- 1 medium sized onion, diced large
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound okra, trimmed (3 cups chopped?)
- 2 tablespoons chopped garlic

- 2 cups cherry tomatoes (or chopped tomatoes)
- 1 heaping cup sweet red peppers, diced large (or one red bell pepper)

- 2 bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 8 springs fresh thyme (plus extra for garnish)

### Directions

- Brown sausage
	- Put 1 tablespoon of the oil in a deep skillet or large pot over medium-high heat. 
	- When hot, add the sausage, prick it with a fork a couple times, and cook until it’s golden brown on all or most sides. 
	- Transfer the sausage to a cutting board.
- Soften Onion
	- Add the onion to the hot pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and turning golden, 2 to 3 minutes. 
	- Meanwhile, slice the sausage crosswise into rounds. Remove the cooked onions with a slotted spoon.
- Brown Okra
	- Add the remaining oil to the pot and stir in the okra. 
	- Cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown a little
	- Add the garlic and cook for another minute or so, stirring once or twice. 
	- Return the sausage and onion to the skillet.
- Break down tomatoes
	- Add the peppers and tomatoes and cook down for about 10 more minutes. 
	- If using cherry tomatoes, place a cover on the pot to get them to cook faster and release moisture. 
	- As the tomatoes break down, the mixture should become thick and pasty.
- Season & Simmer
	- Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper
	- add bay leaves, smoked paprika and thyme and mix well.
	- Stream in the 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent clumping. 
	- Then turn the heat up and cover to bring to a boil. Stir occasionally.
	- Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook uncovered for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew is nicely thickened.
	- If it’s too thick, thin with up to 1/2 cup vegetable broth. If it’s not as thick as you like, just cook it a bit longer.
- Garnish & Serve
	- Add the lemon juice, and adjust salt and pepper to your liking. 
	- Let it sit for 10 minutes. 
	- Remove bay leaves and thyme stems
	- Serve in a big, wide bowl, topped with a scoop of rice and garnished with fresh thyme.

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound spicy smoked sausage or kielbasa
- 1 large onion, halved and cut into thick slices
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound okra, trimmed
- 2 tablespoons chopped garlic
- 4 cups chopped tomato (canned is fine; no need to drain)
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves (optional)

- Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish

### Directions

- Put 1 tablespoon of the oil in a deep skillet or large pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add the sausage, prick it with a fork a couple times, and cook until it’s golden brown on all or most sides. Transfer the sausage to a cutting board.

- Add the onion to the hot pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and turning golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the sausage crosswise into rounds. Remove the cooked onions with a slotted spoon.

- Add the remaining oil to the pot and stir in the okra. Cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown a little, then add the garlic and cook for another minute or so, stirring once or twice. Return the sausage and onion to the skillet and add the tomato, along with a cup of water. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

- Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat so it bubbles gently. Cook, uncovered, stirring every once in a while, until the okra are very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 45 minutes. Stir in the oregano if you like, taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve, garnished with parsley.

### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup flour
- 1 medium sized onion, diced large
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 heaping cup sweet red peppers, diced large (or one red bell pepper)
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes (or chopped tomatoes)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Fresh black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 8 springs fresh thyme (plus extra for garnish)
- 2 1/2 to 3 cups vegetable broth at room temperature
- 2 cups okra (about 10 oz) sliced 1/4 inch thick or so
- 1 1/2 cups cooked kidney beans (a 15 oz can, rinsed and drained)
- 1 1/2 cup cooked garbanzo beans (a 15 oz can, rinsed and drained)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Rice for serving (I used a pretty pink rice)


### Directions

- First we’re going to make a roux, but it has a little less fat than a traditional roux, which means it doesn’t get as goopy. If you’d like a more traditional roux, just add 3 more tablespoons of vegetable oil. Okay, so, let’s proceed.

- Preheat a large, heavy bottom pot over medium-low heat. The wider the pot the better, so that you have lots of surface area to make your roux.

- Add the oil and sprinkle in the flour. Use a wooden spatula to toss the flour in the oil, and stir pretty consistently for 3 to 4 minutes, until the flour is clumpy and toasty.

- Add the onion and salt, and toss to coat the onions completely in the flour mixture. As the onions release moisture, they will coat more and more. Cook this way for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds or so.

- Add the peppers and tomatoes and cook down for about 10 more minutes. If using cherry tomatoes, place a cover on the pot to get them to cook faster and release moisture. As the tomatoes break down, the mixture should become thick and pasty.

- Season with fresh black pepper, add bay leaves, smoked paprika and thyme and mix well.

- Stream in the 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent clumping. Add the okra and beans, then turn the heat up and cover to bring to a boil. Stir occasionally.

- Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook uncovered for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew is nicely thickened and the okra is tender. If it’s too thick, thin with up to 1/2 cup vegetable broth. If it’s not as thick as you like, just cook it a bit longer.

- Add the lemon juice, and adjust salt and pepper to your liking. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves and thyme stems (if you can see them) then serve in a big, wide bowl, topped with a scoop of rice and garnished with fresh thyme.
