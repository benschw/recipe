## Potato Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette
- 4 servings
- 30 minutes, plus time to cool

To me, the best and simplest potato salad is made of just-boiled potatoes dressed in a freshly made vinaigrette. If youâ€™re in a hurry, whisk together the vinaigrette ingredients in a bowl, then just add the potatoes. Parsley and chopped onion are easy, flavorful additions. Recipe from How to Cook Everything.

### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lb waxy potatoes, like red new potatoes or fingerling; or all-purpose, like Yukon Gold (or even starchy baking potatoes are fine)
- 1/2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
- 1/4 cup chopped scallions or red or yellow onion
- 1/2 cup Mustard Vinaigrette, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt

### Instructions

- Peel the potatoes if you like (or wash and scrub them well), then cut them into bite-sized pieces. Put them in a pot with enough water to cover them and add a large pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat so the water bubbles gently. Cook the potatoes until tender but still firm and not all mushy, 15 minutes or so, depending on the potato. Drain, rinse in cold water for a minute, then drain again.

- Toss the still-warm potatoes with the parsley and scallion. Add the vinaigrette until the mixture is as dressed as you like. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding black pepper. Serve as is or refrigerate for an hour or so to chill the salad. (At this point, you may refrigerate the salad, covered, for up to a day.)


## Mustard or Honey Mustard Vinaigrette

### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons or more good wine vinegar
- 1 heaping teaspoon any good mustard or 1/2 teaspoon or so dry mustard
- 1 to 2 tablespoons honey (optional)

### Instructions

- Combine all the ingredients in a blender and turn the machine on; a creamy emulsion will form within 30 seconds. Taste and add vinegar a teaspoon or two at a time until the balance tastes right to you.
- Taste, adjust the seasoning, and serve. (This is best made fresh but will keep, refrigerated, for a few days; bring it back to room temperature and whisk briefly before using.)
