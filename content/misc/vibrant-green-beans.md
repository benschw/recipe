Serves 6

The following recipe is best made just before serving time. But as I mentioned 
in the main post you can make/prep this ahead of time by cooking the leeks and 
dill first and setting them aside. Instead of cooking the green beans in the 
skillet, blanch them in a pot of boiling, well-salted water for about a 
minute. Drain the beans and dunk them in a large bowl of ice water to stop 
the cooking. Drain and place the beans in a bag or bowl in the refrigerator 
until ready to use. When ready, combine the components - you can do it at room 
temperature, or heated quickly in a skillet or pan.

### Ingredients

- 4 leeks, well washed, root end and tops trimmed, sliced lengthwise into quarters and then chopped into 1/2-inch segments (see photo in main post)
- 1/3 cup fresh dill, well chopped
- 3/4 pound green beans, tops and tails trimmed and cut into 1-inch segments
- extra-virgin olive oil
- fine-grain sea salt

### Instructions

- In a large thick-bottomed skillet of medium-high heat add a generous splash of olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and the leeks. 
- Stir until the leeks are coated and glossy. 
- Cook, stirring regularly until a lot of the leeks are golden and crispy. I stir every minute or two in the beginning, and more often as they brown using a metal spatula. (7 - 10 minutes)
- At this point stir in the dill, and then stir in the green beans. Cook for a couple more minutes (just until the the beans brighten up and lose that raw bite)
- Turn out into a bowl or onto a platter and serve immediately
