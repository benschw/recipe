## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 c rice
- 1/3 yellow onion, diced
- 1/2 red bell pepper,diced

- 4 oz chorizo
- 1/2 c frozen peas
- 1 tbsp paprika
- lemon wedges for serving
- salt and pepper to taste
- optional seafood add-ins


## Directions


### Build a Fire

- Let fire burn down to coals
- Rake out enough coals and set grate 6-8 inches above it
- Continue feeding fire and raking coals under grill grate


### Cooking

- fire roasted tomatoes
	- cut in half and remove much of the liquid and seeds	
	- put some olive oil in a bowl and coat each tomato half, allow excess to run off back into bowl
	- place on the grill, skin side down
	- grill until charred, just a few minutes
	- remove, cool enough to handle, and dice

- Build up the sofrito base
	- heat olive oil and saute chorizo for about 5 minutes
	- add onion and bell pepper mix, saute for another 5 minutes
	- add tomatoes and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until it has started to thicken
- Assemble the rest
	- add in rice, chicken, paprika, and peas. stir a few minutes to allow the rice to toast some
	- add the veg stock and stir again
- Cook
	- let cook un disturbed for about 30 minutes, rotating the pan occasionally to avoid hot spots
	- (mix in seafood if using after about 10 minutes)


notes:
- I added liquid as it cooked to keep from drying out, but ended up not getting a crust on the bottom
- I used less of a few ingredients to make sure it fit in the pan
