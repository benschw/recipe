- fire roasted tomatoes

	- put some olive oil in a bowl and coat each tomato half, allow excess to run off back into bowl
	- place on the grill, skin side down
	- grill until charred, just a few minutes
	- remove, cool enough to handle, and dice
- chicken (optional par cook step)
	- coat/marinate chicken in the olive oil used to coat the tomatoes
	- grill for a few minutes: it will cook with paella, just getting a little char here

- Build up the sofrito base
	- heat olive oil and saute chorizo for about 5 minutes
	- add onion and bell pepper mix, saute for another 5 minutes
	- add tomatoes and garlic and cook for about 10 minutes until it has started to thicken
- Assemble the rest
	- add in rice, chicken, paprika, and peas. stir a few minutes to allow the rice to toast some
	- add the veg stock and stir again
- Cook
	- let cook un disturbed for about 30 minutes, rotating the pan occasionally to avoid hot spots
	- (mix in seafood if using after about 10 minutes)
